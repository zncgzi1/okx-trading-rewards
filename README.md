## What Is an OKX Referral Code?

An OKX referral code is your ticket to exclusive rewards when joining the platform. It's a unique identifierâ€”usually a string of numbersâ€”that connects new users to existing members. When you register using someone's referral code, both parties benefit: you get sign-up bonuses, fee discounts, and mystery boxes, while the referrer earns commission from your trading activity.

Think of it like this: OKX wants to reward people for spreading the word. So they've created a system where everyone wins. Your referral code becomes your personal invitation tool once you're registered.

The code we're focusing on today is **"47044926"**. It's currently active and offers some of the best available rewards for new users.

## What Rewards Can You Actually Get?

Let's talk specifics. When you sign up with referral code "47044926," here's what's on the table:

### Welcome Bonus: Up to 100 USDT

After creating your account and completing identity verification, you become eligible for a welcome bonus. The exact amount depends on completing certain tasksâ€”usually depositing funds and executing trades within a specific timeframe.

These tasks aren't complicated. For example, you might need to deposit $50 worth of crypto or complete a spot trade of a certain volume. The requirements change based on your location and the current campaign period, but they're designed to be achievable for most users.

### Trading Fee Discounts: Save 30%

This is where things get interesting. OKX frequently offers 30% rebates on trading fees as part of their welcome package. If you're planning to trade regularly, these savings add up fast.

Here's the math: Let's say you're a moderately active trader doing $10,000 in monthly volume. At standard rates (around 0.1% for takers), you'd pay $10 in fees. With a 30% discount, you're down to $7. That's $3 saved every month, $36 per yearâ€”just from using a referral code.

And it gets better. OKX uses a VIP tier system based on your trading volume and asset balance. As you trade more, your fees drop further. High-volume traders and institutional investors can score even deeper discounts, especially on complex trades like option combos through their RFQ system.

### Mystery Boxes: Free USDT Prizes

Who doesn't love a surprise? OKX regularly runs mystery box campaigns where each box contains crypto rewardsâ€”often up to $50 in USDT per box.

Current campaigns typically offer two mystery boxes: one when you complete KYC verification, another when you deposit at least 50 USDT within seven days of registration. Opening these boxes is like unwrapping a giftâ€”you never know exactly what you'll get, but it's always something valuable.

## Current Campaigns Worth Joining

OKX runs multiple campaigns simultaneously, each with its own prize pool. Here are two major ones running now:

### P2P Exclusive Event: Share 100,000 USDT

This campaign specifically targets users who trade through OKX's peer-to-peer marketplace. For every qualifying task you completeâ€”like making P2P deposits or executing tradesâ€”you earn redemption vouchers. Trade these vouchers for USDT rewards.

The beauty of this campaign? Rewards stack. Complete multiple tasks, collect multiple vouchers, redeem more USDT. The total prize pool sits at 100,000 USDT, so there's plenty to go around.

A few things to remember:
- Only P2P Express or Marketplace deposits count
- Each deposit must stay in your account for at least one day
- Zero-fee trades don't qualify
- Sub-accounts can't participate (only main accounts)

### Autumn Bonanza: Win Up to 60,000 USDT

## How to Activate Your Referral Code (Step-by-Step)

Alright, let's get you set up. The process is straightforward:

### Step 1: Create Your Account

Head to the OKX website or download their mobile app (available on both Android and iOS). Click the "Sign up" buttonâ€”you'll find it in the top right corner.

First, select your country and state of residence. Check the terms and conditions box, then click "Create account."

Now comes the important part: Enter your email address and type **"47044926"** in the referral code field. Don't skip this stepâ€”entering the code during registration is crucial for claiming your bonuses.

After clicking "Sign up," OKX sends a verification code to your email. Enter it to verify. Then you'll authenticate your phone number via SMS. Finally, create a strong password and accept the terms to complete registration.

### Step 2: Verify Your Identity

Here's where KYC comes in. You won't be able to claim rewards or access all platform features without completing identity verification.

Click your profile icon and select "Verification." You'll need to complete two levels:

**Basic verification:** Enter your name, country, and date of birth. Upload a government-issued ID to confirm your identity.

**Advanced verification:** Submit a clear government-issued document (passport, driver's license, or national ID card). Take a selfie and complete facial recognition following the on-screen prompts.

The process usually takes just a few minutes. Once approved, you're ready to deposit and trade.

### Step 3: Make Your First Deposit

To unlock your welcome bonuses, you need to deposit funds within the specified timeframeâ€”usually seven days from registration.

Click "Deposit" in the top right corner of your dashboard. OKX supports multiple deposit methods: crypto transfers, fiat deposits via bank transfer or debit/credit card, and P2P marketplace deposits.

Choose your preferred method and deposit the minimum required amount (often around $50 USDT). Some campaigns also require you to complete at least one trade, so check the specific task requirements for your region.

### Step 4: Claim Your Rewards

Once you've completed the required tasks, visit the OKX Rewards Centerâ€”accessible through both the website and mobile app.

Your bonuses should appear here, ready to claim. Click to activate them, but don't wait too longâ€”most rewards expire within 30 days. Use them or lose them.

## Building Your Own Referral Network

Once you're registered, OKX gives you your own referral code and link. This is where things get interesting for anyone who wants to earn passive income.

### Finding Your Referral Code

Log in to your account and click the "More" tab. Select "Referral" from the dropdown menu. This takes you to your referral dashboard, where your unique invite code and link are displayed.

Share this code with friends, family, or your online network. Every time someone registers using your code and starts trading, you earn commissionâ€”typically a percentage of their trading fees.
